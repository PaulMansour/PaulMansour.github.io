        </header>
        <p>In a <a href="/posts/text-to-date">previous post</a> I discussed the problem of converting time strings to time numbers. I have now extracted this functionality from our main application, rewritten it, and made it an open source project, imaginatively, but prematurely, named <a href="https://github.com/the-carlisle-group\Text2Date">Text2Date</a>.                       Text2Date uses a modified version of the Dyalog format pattern that is the left argument of <code>1200⌶</code>.</p>
        <p>One useful recent, simplifying, insight gained in the process of rewriting  is that differentiating between undelimited  and delimited fixed-width formats strings is useful. Delimited fixed-width time strings must line up - the elements must be in the exact positions specified in the format string.   Undelimited format strings do not require that the time strings line up. For example, the format string <code>MMDDYY</code> can easily  process the character matrix:</p>
        <pre><code>123124
10125
  72476
011523
</code></pre>
        <p>yielding four dates:</p>
        <pre><code>      'MMDDYY' Text2Date '123124' '10125' '  72476   ' '011523'
20241231 20250101 19760724 20230115
</code></pre>
        <p>When there are no delimiters, we don't need to worry about where an element starts or ends. The time string is just a text representation of a date time packed into an integer. A missing leading zero is no problem. Leading and trailing blanks are no problem. Data in this format shows up all the time in Excel and CSV files out in the wild. </p>
        <p>In the case of undelimited formats, there is also no need that the input are time strings, numeric is just as good, if not better. <code>Text2Date</code> is now misnamed, as this works:</p>
        <pre><code>      'MMDDYY' Text2Date 123124 10125 72476 011523
20241231 20250101 19760724 20230115
</code></pre>
        <p>Three special format strings are also accepted: <code>Excel</code> or <code>Excel1900</code>, and <code>Excel1904</code>, which also work on text or numeric input:</p>
        <pre><code>      'Excel' Text2Date 35000 37125 41256
19951028 20010822 20121213
      'Excel' Text2Date '35000' '37125' '41256'
19951028 20010822 20121213

          </h1>
          <h2>February 20, 2023</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Once we have written some nice, succinct APL code, it is disheartening to muck it all up with error trapping. There are many techniques, and often we just sling <code>⎕TRAP</code>, <code>:Trap</code>, <code>⎕SIGNAL</code> and error guards willy-nilly. It would be nice have to some tried and true patterns to apply, and extract as much messiness as possible.</p>
        <p>The best error trapping is none at all, or rather, left to functions further up the stack. But if we are providing a package to be used by others, and the API consists of more than utility functions like deleting extraneous blanks, we should provide some minimal distinction between a user error and a bug. This post explores one possible pattern, used in the <a href="https://github.com/the-carlisle-group/Text2Date">Text2Date</a> project.</p>
        <p>For some packages, there is no need to invent new error numbers and  event messages. However, we need a way to distinguish between, say, a length error that we anticipate, and one that we don't.  Two functions will suffice to extract all the needed logic:</p>
        <pre><code>Signal←{
     ⎕SIGNAL⊂('EN'(⍺+500))('Message'⍵)
 }
</code></pre>
        <p>and</p>
        <pre><code>f←ReSignal
f←⎕SIGNAL{
    ⊂('EN'(⍵.EN-500))('Message'⍵.Message)
}
</code></pre>
        <p>The <code>Signal</code> function wraps <code>⎕SIGNAL</code>, and specifies the <strong>error number</strong> and <strong>message</strong> for <code>⎕DMX</code>. The error number is bumped up by an arbitrary multiple of 100 (from 100 to 900), to distinguish it from an unexpected error. So, for example, if the left argument to an API function requires a 1 or 0, to signal a DOMAIN ERROR we might write:</p>
        <pre><code>~⍺∊0 1:11 Signal 'The left argument must be 0 or 1'
</code></pre>
        <p>Note that <code>Signal</code> reverses the arguments of <code>⎕SIGNAL</code>. This is because <code>⎕SIGNAL</code> is more often than not called with <code>⍨</code> as the right argument is almost always a literal scalar, while the left argument is often constructed. </p>
        <p>At the top of any API function we include the error guard:  </p>
        <pre><code>500+⍳100::ReSignal ⎕DMX
</code></pre>
        <p>This traps all errors in our arbitrary block of 100, and using <code>ReSignal</code> propagates expected errors to the calling function. Unexpected errors remain untrapped and fail where they are. <code>ReSignal</code> only specifies the event number <code>EN</code> and <code>Message</code> for <code>⎕DMX</code>. The event message <code>EM</code> is automatically provided. <code>ReSignal</code> is a niladic trad function that returns a function. The reason for this subterfuge is that we want to encapsulate the right side of this error guard:</p>
        <pre><code>300+⍳100::⎕SIGNAL ⊂('EN'(⎕DMX.EN-500))('Message'⎕DMX.Message)
</code></pre>
        <p>as this is far too much code to be copying and pasting all over the place. But <code>⎕SIGNAL</code> itself cannot be wrapped inside a function (trad or dfn) or it will not break out of the main function. It must signal in the scope of the main API function. The code to the right of <code>⎕SIGNAL</code> could easily be wrapped, but it would be nice to include the whole thing. Thus the trad function <code>ReSignal</code> returns a function that includes the whole thing, but keeps the <code>⎕SIGNAL</code> out of the subfunction.  This encapsulation technique is lifted from <a href="https://github.com/abrudz/dyalog_vision/blob/main/%E2%88%86SIGNAL.aplf">Adám Brudzewsky</a>.                                                             </p>

          <h2>February 13, 2023</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Framework is a big word for what is going on here. But testing <strong>utility</strong>, or testing <strong>application</strong> seem no better. Anyway, for years my testing "framework" has been more or less:</p>
        <pre><code>RunTests←{
     f←'T'⍵.⎕NL ¯3
     b←⍵{
        b←⍺⍎⍵,' 0'
        ⎕←⍵,': ',b⊃'Passed' '*** Failed ***'
        b}¨f
     tf←+/b
     r←⊂'Tests run: ',⍕≢b
     r,←⊂'Passed: ',⍕+/~b
     r,←⊂'Failed: ',⍕+/b
     ⊃r
 } 
</code></pre>
        <p>This runs on a namespace full of test functions that return a 1 or 0 for success and  failure respectively. I would just copy this snippet to each new project, making a little application specific modification here and there. This could use a little improvement, but I don't want it to become a huge, unwieldy framework with lots of options, classes, methods, etc. I don't really want to write tests for my test framework, or much documentation. But I do want it to report code coverage, to have an option for stopping on failure, and to handle broken tests and other conditions.  </p>
        <p>My new and improved "framework" is now its own Github repository <a href="https://github.com/the-carlisle-group/Provanto">Provanto</a>. Unfortunately, despite my best efforts, is has grown from  one function of a dozen lines to 8 functions nearing a total of 100 lines: </p>

</code></pre>
        <p>The API is limited to the <code>Run</code> function:</p>
        <pre><code>      {Z}←[X [Y]] Provanto.Run A [B]  
</code></pre>
        <p>Where <code>A</code> is a namespace full of test functions, <code>B</code> is an optional namespace full of code that triggers a code coverage feature, <code>X</code> is a flag for stopping on failing or broken tests and <code>Y</code> is a flag for suppressing session output.  <code>Z</code>, the shy result, is a namespace full of test results, if needed for further processing or reporting. </p>
        <p>The run function injects a function <code>Assert</code> and an operator <code>Try</code> into the test namespace. In a test, the Assert function is called to the left of a naked guard. I first saw this technique, and use of word <strong>assert</strong> in this context, from the late great Roger Hui. Like Roger's, the Provanto <code>Assert</code> function uses only a right argument and does not embed the <code>match</code> function inside <code>Assert</code>. Thus a line in a test function looks like:</p>
        <pre><code>      Assert 4=2+2:
</code></pre>
        <p>This reads a little better than putting a value to the left, and in addition it leaves open the option of applying other functions besides <code>match</code> to produce a boolean without additional logic. A test function is thus a gauntlet of assertions terminated by a <code>0</code>:</p>
        <pre><code>TestPlus←{
     Assert 4=2+2:
     Assert 2 3 4≡1 2 3+1:
     Assert 5 6≡2+3 4:
     Assert 5=2 3+Try 4 5 6:
     Assert 11=2+Try'A':
     0
 }
</code></pre>
        <p>The <code>Try</code> operator attempts to execute a function, trapping and returning any error:</p>
        <pre><code>       Assert 5=2 3+Try 4 5 6:
</code></pre>
        <p>If a code namespace is provided, code coverage is computed with <code>⎕PROFILE</code>, and functions (with an explicit list of lines) that are not executed by the  tests are displayed in the session.</p>
        <p>What more is needed? No doubt the <code>Profile</code> function could be cleaned up a bit. A large application might have multiple test namespaces, so we might want to have a cover function to run them all, or enhance <code>Run</code> to take multiple test namespaces.  </p>
        <p>The next step is to review Lars Stampe Villadsen's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B7YE79DASY">presentation</a> from the Dyalog 2023 conference and get this stuff running automatically on Github.</p>
