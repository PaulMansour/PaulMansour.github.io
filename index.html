        <p>I'm currently in the process of extracting a GUI testing framework from a private project  and adding it to <a href="https://github.com/the-carlisle-group/provanto">Provanto</a>.  Writing automated GUI tests for <code>⎕WC</code> applications is somewhat of a dark art. Nowhere is the principle of Test Driven Development (TDD) more important than with GUI programming and <code>⎕WC</code>. Writing GUI code without forethought will invariably yield code that is simply untestable. Of course we don't have forethought until we have written a bunch of GUI code first, and then attempted to write test code,  so we are generally doomed to have untestable GUI code that must be rewritten.</p>
        <p>Future posts will explore the underlying framework code in detail. Here we just take a look at the overall basics, what a test function looks like, and how to write one. Once the dark art is mastered and burried in the framework, and we learn how to write testable GUI apps, the tests themselves are clean, neat, and simple to write, read, and maintain.</p>
        <p>Testing a GUI starts with a reference to the primary form object of an application. The <code>Init</code> function takes this form, intantiates a few properties in it, and then injects a few functions back into the test namespace:</p>
        <pre><code>Init←{
     ⍵.on999←1
     ⍵.DequeueTimes←4
     ⍵.ActionDelay←0
     ⍵.KeyPressDelay←0
     t←⊃⎕RSI
     t.Keys←KeySpace 0
     t.G←⎕THIS
     _←⍵ Fix¨API 0
     0
 }
</code></pre>
        <p>In addition to <code>Assert</code> and <code>Try</code> (the functions that Provanto injects into the test space), we now will have two more reserved words: <code>Enter</code> and <code>Get</code>. Both of the these functions are bound with the reference to the form, so it is not needed as an argument.</p>
        <p>The <code>Init</code> function may be called in the <code>Startup</code> function for a suite of tests, or  directly in a test function.  </p>
        <p>Provanto includes a sample GUI application and a few tests to show how it is done. A typical GUI test fires events on objects, then inspects the state of the GUI and the application and makes assertions. Let's take a look at one:</p>
        <pre><code>TestAllowDigitsProperty←{
     s←GetAppState 0
     e←Get'Name'
     Assert~s.AllowDigits:
     Enter'Name' 'A12B345C':
     Assert e.Text≡'ABC':
     Enter'AllowDigits':
     Assert s.AllowDigits:
     Enter'Name' '12345':
     Assert e.Text≡'ABC12345':
     Enter'AllowDigits':
     Assert~s.AllowDigits:
     0
 }
</code></pre>
        <p>This function assumes that <code>Init</code> has already been called. <code>GetAppState</code> is an application specfic helper function that returns a namespace with a few variables representing the state of the application.  Of course in a real application, the application state may be represented by a complex object model, or a folder on disk, or both and more. </p>
        <p>The <code>Get</code> function takes the name of a GUI object and returns a reference to it, providing access to the state of the GUI.</p>
        <p>The <code>Enter</code> function allows us to fire events at the GUI.  To click on a push button or menu item, or to change the state of a radio button or check box, we simply call the <code>Enter</code> function with the name of the object. To enter text in an edit box, we call <code>Enter</code> with both the name of the object and the text to enter.</p>
        <p>We can also fire specific events. For example, to double click on the <code>Name</code> edit object:</p>
        <pre><code>Enter 'Name' (⊂'MouseDblClick')
</code></pre>
        <p>A full event message may be provided as well:</p>
        <pre><code>Enter 'Name' ('KeyPress' 'RC' 0 39 0) 
</code></pre>
        <p><code>KeyPress</code> events are very common, so a namespace with <code>KeyPress</code> events is provided, to make it easy to fire specific keys on objects:</p>
        <pre><code>Enter 'Name' Keys.RightCursor  
</code></pre>
        <p>The above test is implement as a dfn, and thus naked guards are necessary to prevent the function from exiting on the lines that lack an assignment, specifically the lines calling <code>Enter</code>. We could of course assign a useless result, but it adds a lot of clutter. The naked guard is already used on the lines making assertions, so its not that much of stretch, but some might find it objectionable. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it. A trad function works just as well, arguably cleaner if there are not too many local variables:</p>
        <pre><code> z←TestAllowDigitsProperty x;s;e
 s←GetAppState 0
 e←Get'Name'
 Assert~s.AllowDigits
 Enter'Name' 'A12B345C'
 Assert e.Text≡'ABC'
 Enter'AllowDigits'
 Assert s.AllowDigits
 Enter'Name' '12345'
 Assert e.Text≡'ABC12345'
 Enter'AllowDigits'
 Assert~s.AllowDigits
 z←0 
</code></pre>
        <p>The main point is that both of these function, the dfn and trad fn, have little to no extraneous code. The functions are easy to write and read. The two API functions <code>Enter</code> and <code>Get</code> provide almost all that is needed. The test functions are also easy to trace, and you can see exactly what the GUI is doing while stepping through them.</p>

          <h2>May 13, 2023</h2>
        </header>
        <p>In a recent post titled <a href="https://www.sacrideo.us/suggestivity-and-idioms-in-apl/">Suggestivity and Idioms in APL</a> on his blog <a href="https://www.sacrideo.us/tag/apl/">Fastidious Elegance</a> Arron Hsu enumerates all the permutations and combinations of logical pairwise reductions on Boolean vectors. There are 10 scalar dyadic relational functions and Aaron throws in <code>⊣</code> and  <code>⊢</code> as well for total of 12 functions. With the catenation of 1 or 0 on the front or the back, to keep the result the same shape as the input, there are <code>12×2×2</code> or <code>48</code> possible combinations. </p>
        <p>It would be convenient to be able to describe in short terms what each of these Boolean transformations does. If we can't meaningfully name them, we probably cannot effectively use them. If we are going to search for these expressions on, say, <a href="https://aplcart.info">APL Cart</a>, we need to have some way to describe them.</p>
        <p>In his 1987 book <strong>APL - Advanced Techniques and Utilities</strong>, Gary Bergquist uses the terms <em>maps</em> and  <em>poles</em> to facilitate discussion of Boolean vectors and techniques: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>A "maps" vector is a Boolean vector which consists of sets of contiguous 1s (1-maps) separated by one or more 0s, (0-maps). For example, the following bit vector contains 3 1-maps and 4 0-maps:</p>
          <pre><code>0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0
</code></pre>
          <p>A "leading" 1-poles vector is a Boolean vector which consists of pairs of 1s  separated by zero or more 0s. The 1's are called "poles".  The left pole in each pair may be viewed as the starting element of a set of contiguous elements.  The right pole in each pair may be viewed as the next element beyond the ending element of the set. For example, the following bit vector contains 3 pairs of leading 1-poles:</p>
          <pre><code>0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0  
</code></pre>
          <p>Notice that 1-maps and leading 1-poles are alternative means of conveying the  same information. Basically they identify spans of contiguous elements. 1-maps do so by using 1s to flag the elements within the spans. Leading 1-poles do so by using 1s to flag the starts of spans and the starts of non-spans (hence the  word "leading").</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We can flip the bits and discuss 0-maps and leading 0-poles as well. These terms do not represent any inherent properties of Boolean vectors, but rather an interpretation of what the 1's and 0's mean. The same Boolean vector could be a 1-maps vector in one context and a 1-poles vector in another context.   This, however, does not lessen the usefulness of the terms. With this terminolgy in hand, we can interpret  <code>≠\</code> as converting leading 1-poles to 1-maps, and <code>=\</code> as converting leading 0-poles to 0-maps.</p>
        <p>How many of Aaron's 48 permutations can be succinctly described with this lexicon? Gary defines and names 6 transformations, using shift-and-compare techniques that pre-date the introduction of n-wise reduction. We can find the corresponding 6 transformations in Aaron's 48 by inspection:  </p>

        <p>Aaron may be a bit optimistic when he writes that <em>almost all of the binary relations that we can imagine in use here find some meaningful interpretation</em>, but here we have 12 simple, visually suggestive, well-named expressions using the language of maps and poles. That's a good start. Can we find more?</p>

        <p>The other day I turned trapping off:</p>
        <pre><code>      600⌶1
2 
</code></pre>
        <p>And attempted to run a user command:</p>
        <pre><code>      ]display ⍳10
VALUE ERROR: Undefined name: exact
findCmdPos[1] exact←{6::⍵ ⋄ exact}~ASN ⍝ exact match?
</code></pre>
        <p>...which fails due to a <strong>micro trap</strong>.</p>
        <p>I'm not picking on user commands here, my apps do this all over the place and it's a bad idea. With trap control set to 1, virtually no aspect of my apps will run. I don't think that should be. Error guards are seductive because they are terse. It's a little annoying to write: </p>
        <pre><code>      {0=⎕NC 'exact':⍵ ⋄ exact}
</code></pre>
        <p>But the explicit test is a better practice. Sure, we can turn trap control on and off, we can put a stop flag in a function to get us to the point where we can safely turn trapping off to proceed to the error we are looking for, but it's all messy.</p>
        <p>There is virtually no scenario during development where we want a micro trap like this to not work. We are abusing the error guard. </p>
        <p>Many times we can avoid micro traps and even guards by refactoring.  Micro traps are often a sign of technical debt: we have no idea how or why a certain state arises, but it does, so we trap around it. Regardless, if we must handle the case instead of finding and eliminating the root cause, it is better to explicitly test for it.</p>
