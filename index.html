        <p>In this post we   review the current <a href="https://github.com/the-carlisle-group/Rumba">Rumba</a> threading model, consider an alternative, and take a look at how <a href="https://github.com/Dyalog/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> does it.</p>
        <p>Currently in Rumba, the threading model is as follows. The <em>server event loop</em>, calling <code>DRC.Wait</code>, handles all events on the server and all sockets. If the event is a <code>Connect</code> event, a new connection space is established and a thread is spawned. This new <em>connection thread</em> is immediately waiting, in a <em>connection event loop</em>, using <code>⎕TGET</code>, for events passed to it from the server event loop using <code>⎕TPUT</code>.  All other events are either handled immediately in the server event loop, or passed off for handling to the appropriate connection thread. For example, the <code>Error</code> event is handled immediately in the main thread, but an <code>HTTPChunk</code> event is passed to the appropriate connection thread.</p>
        <p>When a connection thread has a complete message, it will service it in the same connection thread (not spawning a new thread). Thus it will respond to multiple messages from the same client,  in proper order, with no additional thread coordination. </p>
        <p>Alternatively, we can use the <code>ConnectionOnly</code> property of Conga, and have the server event loop only handle <code>Connect</code> events. As above, a new connection space is established and  connection thread is spawned. In this case, however, the connection event loop is wrapped around another call to <code>DRC.Wait</code>. There is no need for <code>⎕TGET</code> or <code>⎕TPUT</code>. The connection event loop is now tasked with directly handling events from Conga, via <code>DRC.Wait</code>, but only for the specific connection. We have delegated some logic to Conga itself. </p>
        <p>Let's call the first technique SCW (Single Conga Wait) and the alternative MCW (Multiple Conga Wait) </p>
        <p>What are the pros and cons of these two techniques? Here are a few:</p>
        <p>With SCW, we have the option of handling any event either in the main thread or in the appropriate connection thread. All events are received in the main thread, and we can process them there or chuck them to a waiting connection thread. With MCW the die is cast. All events other than <code>Connect</code> (and <code>Error</code>  and <code>Timeout</code>?) must be handled in connection threads. This may increase thread coordination problems. This might be a major advantage for SCW.</p>
        <p>With SCW, every time around the server event loop, we must retrieve the connection space (if it's not a <code>Connect</code> event) from the connection name as returned from <code>DRC.Wait</code>. With MCW,  we have the connection space in hand on the Connect event, and it is passed  to the connection event loop. So we never need to look it up or retrieve it. This is probably a minor advantage, if any, for MCW in speed, but maybe a major advantage in coding clarity.  </p>
        <p>With SCW we only receive <code>Timeout</code> events on the server as a whole. With MCW we can receive them on the server and on individual connections (I think. I don't know this for a fact.) Currently in Rumba with SCW we track the timestamp on the latest activity on a connection, so we can close idle connections. This could be handled with less fuss with MCW.</p>
        <p>It seems that MCW might lead to simpler APL code. Events are either server events or connection events, and MCW lets Conga sort that part out.    </p>
        <p>Jarvis, like Rumba currently, uses a single call to  <code>DRC.Wait</code>. However, instead of spawning a thread on each connection, it spawns a thread on each (HTTP) event. Then when the message is complete, it handles the request in whatever the current thread is. Thus a typical HTTP request takes 2 threads, one for the header, and one for the body which is then  used to handle the request and prepare the response. A chunked request requires a thread for every single chunk, so a request with 100 chunks will require 102 threads, the extra 2 for the header and trailer) These additional threads have very little to do, and will be very short-lived, so that's not a big downside. However, the additional threads require more thread coordination, including the use of both <code>:Hold</code> and <code>⎕TGET/⎕TPUT</code>. </p>
        <p>It's not at all clear if there are any performance difference between these three models.</p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/the-carlisle-group/Rumba">Rumba</a> has been around a long time. Mostly it was written as an exercise to understand HTTP, but is has also proved quite useful for testing sites and applications that may be served by other means in production.</p>
        <p>When Rumba was originally written, Dyalog's TCP toolkit <a href="https://docs.dyalog.com/latest/Conga%20User%20Guide.pdf">Conga</a>, on which Rumba is based, did not support HTTP directly. Much code in Rumba is devoted to parsing TCP messages to know where the header ends and the body starts, where chunks start and end, etc. Now Conga supports HTTP. Furthermore it supports WebSockets, which requires the new HTTP functionality. In addition Conga has made some improvements to the event handling that clean up some things. The need for Abacus to use WebSockets is the catalyst for updating Rumba to take advantage of all that Conga now has to offer.</p>
        <p>Rather than jettisoning the original code, we have a new Rumba server property <code>UseCongaHTTP</code> which  defaults to 0. Setting to <code>1</code> does the obvious, instructing Rumba to use Conga's HTTP mode. Being able run a Rumba server both ways is useful for testing.</p>
        <p>The new code is, for now in a <a href="https://github.com/the-carlisle-group/Rumba/tree/feature/WebSockets">temporary branch</a>, where it will probably remain for a few months.</p>
        <p>Conga also now has features to fully parse the header and trailer. These features are not taken advantage of yet in Rumba, as we don't want to introduce too many changes at once.      We are, however, taking advantage of the new Conga <code>EventMode</code> property to streamline code and get rid of some magic numbers that Conga used to produce.</p>
        <p>Because Rumba is heavily threaded and written largely in dfns, it has to use some tradfn workarounds to avoid a long-standing bug in the interpreter. This bug is now fixed in Dyalog version 19, so we can eliminate the workarounds.  </p>
        <p>Taking advantage of Conga's HTTP mode while not substantially rewriting Rumba required certain decisions about threading. The current threading model may not be the best. In a future post we will review the threading model for Rumba, see how it was adapted to use Conga's HTTP mode, compare it to what Dyalog's <a href="https://github.com/Dyalog/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> does, and see if there are any better alternatives.</p>

        <p>For an Abacus application, we need a way to organize our CSS, apply themes, provide some default application layout and styling, and also let the programmer override everything.</p>
        <p>An Abacus document (and any element) has a <code>Style</code> property which is a vector of CSS rules. For static documents, this property is generally set directly by the programmer. When a document represents an SPA built on Abacus components, we need to be able to assemble additional rules, and provide a way for the programmer to organize them. Two additional properties are provided to specify CSS rules: <code>LayoutStyle</code> and <code>ApplicationStyle</code>. </p>
        <p>The <code>LayoutStyle</code> property contains CSS rules for top level layout. This might be something like the header, main and footer elements of the app.   </p>
        <p>For an SPA, the <code>Style</code> property of the root <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element should not be set (it will be overridden if it is set). Abacus will automatically set this property, constructing it from the 'LayoutStyle<code> and </code>ApplicationStyle` properties, as well as the component library styles.  </p>
        <p>The order in which styles are applied is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>LayoutStyle (user provided, though Abacus should have a library of useful ones)  </li>
          <li>Abacus Styles (provided by Abacus, including built-in component ) </li>
          <li>ApplicationStyle (user provided)  </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In other words, the programmer can provide styles to be applied before and after the built in styles provided by Abacus. These groups of CSS rules are, in the end, arbitrary. I'm not even sure the programmer needs to be able specify rules before the Abacus rules, but certainly after. However I do think it is useful to split apart, for example, a rule that says the button radius should be 5px, from a rule that says the &lt;body&gt; element of the document should flex.</p>
        <p>It should be possible to create an attractive application by simply specifying a layout provided by Abacus.</p>
        <p>Abacus uses APL functions to construct CSS. We call these CSS functions. A CSS function takes a <strong>theme</strong> as its right argument. A theme is simply a namespace of names and values, defining colors, font names and size, and other parameters. It performs the same function as CSS custom properties.</p>
        <p>Much or all of this will probably change.</p>
