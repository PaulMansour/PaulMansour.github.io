        <p>Abacus now supports <a href="https://github.com/the-carlisle-group/Abacus/tree/master/APLSource/Main/ToolTip">tool tips</a>. The relatively new (Chrome 125) CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning">anchor positioning module</a> makes this almost easy. More about anchor positioning can be found <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/anchor-positioning-api">here.</a>. However, both of these articles actually raise more questions than they answer. For example, it appears that anchor names should be unique. However, in many of the examples, an anchor name is defined for a class, not an id, which seem a bit odd. Thus we need to go to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-anchor-position-1/">source</a>. Here we learn that anchor names do not in fact not need to be unique, and that they can be scoped. Unfortunately the <code>anchor-scope</code> property is not yet implemented in Chrome, let alone any other browser. Another, bigger problem is that anchors can currently only be defined in CSS. The spec allows for defining them  in HTML with the <code>anchor</code> attribute which points to an id, but this is not yet implemented. If every tool button needs a specific CSS rule to define it as an anchor for it's associated tool tip,  <em>and</em> vice versa, every tool-tip needs an id and CSS to point to the right anchor, that is annoying to say the least. While much of the API is not yet implemented, the important stuff for us is there: the browser will automatically display the tool tip just where we want it, moving it around as necessary if it would otherwise be off the screen. So for now, given what is currently supported in Chrome, here is our approach.  We can totally change our approach in the future as the anchor position API is further implemented.</p>
        <p>To use tool tips in Abacus, all we need to do is set the ToolTip property of an element in the APL DOM, there is no need to explicitly use the ToolTip component:</p>
        <pre><code>b←A.New 'button' 'OK'   
b.ToolTip←'This is the OK button'
</code></pre>
        <p>Abacus automatically adds a single tool tip element to the page behind the scenes with:</p>
        <pre><code>New←{
     ⍝ ⍺ ←→ Parent (Body)
     ⍺←0
     t←⍺ A.New'div'
     t.class←'tool-tip'
     t.LastAnchor←0
     t
 }
</code></pre>
        <p>(We could use an id here instead of a class, as there is only one tool tip element on a page.) This one element is used to display all tools tips. We will move it around the page to different locations by dynamically setting the associated tool button to be its anchor for the moment the tool tip appears. </p>
        <p>Abacus then finds all elements on the page that have the ToolTip property and initializes them: </p>
        <pre><code>Init←{
     ⍝ ⍵ ←→ Element(s)
     b←{0=⍵.⎕NC'ToolTip':0 ⋄ 1}¨⍵
     e←b/⍵
     0=≢e:0
     e.Onmouseenter←⊂A.FQP'OnMouseEnter'
     e.Onmouseleave←⊂A.FQP'OnMouseLeave'
     e.Unqueued←⊂'mouseenter' 'mouseleave'
     0
 }
</code></pre>
        <p>Now each tool button has events attached for <code>mouseenter</code> and <code>mouseleave</code>. On mouseenter, we start a timer:</p>
        <pre><code>OnMouseEnter←{
     t←⍎'tmT'⎕WC'Timer' 200 1('FireOnce' 1)
     t.onTimer←'OnMouseEnterTimer'⍵
     0
 }
</code></pre>
        <p>And then when the timer fires, we set the text of the tool tip, and change the anchor from the previous element that displayed a tool tip, to the current element that should display a tool tip. We also set <code>opacity</code> to  get a nice transition from invisible to visible:</p>
        <pre><code>OnMouseEnterTimer←{
     e←⍺.CurrentTarget
     t←⍺.Document.ToolTip
     _←t A.SetInnerHTML A.New'p'e.ToolTip
     P←t.LastAnchor A.RemoveProperty'anchor-name'
     t.LastAnchor←e
     _←e A.SetAnchorName'--tool-tip'
     _←t A.SetStyle'opacity' '1'
     0
 }
</code></pre>
        <p>On mouse leave we kill the timer, and make the tooltip invisible:</p>
        <pre><code>OnMouseLeave←{
     tmT.Active←0
     t←⍵.Document.ToolTip
     _←t A.SetStyle'opacity' '0'
     0
 }
</code></pre>
        <p>Note that we do not clear the <code>anchor-name</code> property at this point, as this would affect the  fade-out opacity transition; the tool tip would change locations before fully fading out.</p>
        <p>The important CSS is:</p>
        <pre><code>CSS←{
     Rule←##.NewRule
     s←Rule'.tool-tip'
     s.position←'absolute'
     s.z_index←'99'
     s.position_anchor←'--tool-tip'
     s.inset_area←'bottom right'
     s.position_try_options←'flip-block, flip-inline, flip-block flip-inline'
     s.opacity←0
     s.transition←'opacity .5s'
     s
 }
</code></pre>
        <p>So, to recap, there is single tool tip element, that always points to a floating anchor named '--tool-tip'. As the mouse hovers over a tool button, we assign that button the anchor-name (clearing the name from the previous tool button), and make the tool-tip visible. </p>
        <p>Some observations on this implementation:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The tool tips are not in the HTML. This is probably not a good idea for accessibilty, but probably won't change until the API is fully implemented.</li>
          <li>We do not use the popover API for the tool tip, just the hack of setting <code>z-index</code>. The popover API does not currently support triggering the popover on mouseover, so JavaScript is required anyway.</li>
          <li>This is a very dynamic solution, which has pros and cons. It requires server side APL code (JavaScript!). It's possible that when both the popover API and the anchor positioning API are fully implemented in the browser, that this could be done declaratively in HTML and CSS only. Short of that, much more of the current solution could be moved into the HTML.</li>
        </ol>

          </h1>
          <h2>July 28, 2024</h2>
        </header>
        <p>In this post we   review the current <a href="https://github.com/the-carlisle-group/Rumba">Rumba</a> threading model, consider an alternative, and take a look at how <a href="https://github.com/Dyalog/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> does it.</p>
        <p>Currently in Rumba, the threading model is as follows. The <em>server event loop</em>, calling <code>DRC.Wait</code>, handles all events on the server and all sockets. If the event is a <code>Connect</code> event, a new connection space is established and a thread is spawned. This new <em>connection thread</em> is immediately waiting, in a <em>connection event loop</em>, using <code>⎕TGET</code>, for events passed to it from the server event loop using <code>⎕TPUT</code>.  All other events are either handled immediately in the server event loop, or passed off for handling to the appropriate connection thread. For example, the <code>Error</code> event is handled immediately in the main thread, but an <code>HTTPChunk</code> event is passed to the appropriate connection thread.</p>
        <p>When a connection thread has a complete message, it will service it in the same connection thread (not spawning a new thread). Thus it will respond to multiple messages from the same client,  in proper order, with no additional thread coordination. </p>
        <p>Alternatively, we can use the <code>ConnectionOnly</code> property of Conga, and have the server event loop only handle <code>Connect</code> events. As above, a new connection space is established and  connection thread is spawned. In this case, however, the connection event loop is wrapped around another call to <code>DRC.Wait</code>. There is no need for <code>⎕TGET</code> or <code>⎕TPUT</code>. The connection event loop is now tasked with directly handling events from Conga, via <code>DRC.Wait</code>, but only for the specific connection. We have delegated some logic to Conga itself. </p>
        <p>Let's call the first technique SCW (Single Conga Wait) and the alternative MCW (Multiple Conga Wait) </p>
        <p>What are the pros and cons of these two techniques? Here are a few:</p>
        <p>With SCW, we have the option of handling any event either in the main thread or in the appropriate connection thread. All events are received in the main thread, and we can process them there or chuck them to a waiting connection thread. With MCW the die is cast. All events other than <code>Connect</code> (and <code>Error</code>  and <code>Timeout</code>?) must be handled in connection threads. This may increase thread coordination problems. This might be a major advantage for SCW.</p>
        <p>With SCW, every time around the server event loop, we must retrieve the connection space (if it's not a <code>Connect</code> event) from the connection name as returned from <code>DRC.Wait</code>. With MCW,  we have the connection space in hand on the Connect event, and it is passed  to the connection event loop. So we never need to look it up or retrieve it. This is probably a minor advantage, if any, for MCW in speed, but maybe a major advantage in coding clarity.  </p>
        <p>With SCW we only receive <code>Timeout</code> events on the server as a whole. With MCW we can receive them on the server and on individual connections (I think. I don't know this for a fact.) Currently in Rumba with SCW we track the timestamp on the latest activity on a connection, so we can close idle connections. This could be handled with less fuss with MCW.</p>
        <p>It seems that MCW might lead to simpler APL code. Events are either server events or connection events, and MCW lets Conga sort that part out.    </p>
        <p>Jarvis, like Rumba currently, uses a single call to  <code>DRC.Wait</code>. However, instead of spawning a thread on each connection, it spawns a thread on each (HTTP) event. Then when the message is complete, it handles the request in whatever the current thread is. Thus a typical HTTP request takes 2 threads, one for the header, and one for the body which is then  used to handle the request and prepare the response. A chunked request requires a thread for every single chunk, so a request with 100 chunks will require 102 threads, the extra 2 for the header and trailer) These additional threads have very little to do, and will be very short-lived, so that's not a big downside. However, the additional threads require more thread coordination, including the use of both <code>:Hold</code> and <code>⎕TGET/⎕TPUT</code>. </p>
        <p>It's not at all clear if there are any performance difference between these three models.</p>

          <h2>July 17, 2024</h2>
        </header>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/the-carlisle-group/Rumba">Rumba</a> has been around a long time. Mostly it was written as an exercise to understand HTTP, but is has also proved quite useful for testing sites and applications that may be served by other means in production.</p>
        <p>When Rumba was originally written, Dyalog's TCP toolkit <a href="https://docs.dyalog.com/latest/Conga%20User%20Guide.pdf">Conga</a>, on which Rumba is based, did not support HTTP directly. Much code in Rumba is devoted to parsing TCP messages to know where the header ends and the body starts, where chunks start and end, etc. Now Conga supports HTTP. Furthermore it supports WebSockets, which requires the new HTTP functionality. In addition Conga has made some improvements to the event handling that clean up some things. The need for Abacus to use WebSockets is the catalyst for updating Rumba to take advantage of all that Conga now has to offer.</p>
        <p>Rather than jettisoning the original code, we have a new Rumba server property <code>UseCongaHTTP</code> which  defaults to 0. Setting to <code>1</code> does the obvious, instructing Rumba to use Conga's HTTP mode. Being able run a Rumba server both ways is useful for testing.</p>
        <p>The new code is, for now in a <a href="https://github.com/the-carlisle-group/Rumba/tree/feature/WebSockets">temporary branch</a>, where it will probably remain for a few months.</p>
        <p>Conga also now has features to fully parse the header and trailer. These features are not taken advantage of yet in Rumba, as we don't want to introduce too many changes at once.      We are, however, taking advantage of the new Conga <code>EventMode</code> property to streamline code and get rid of some magic numbers that Conga used to produce.</p>
        <p>Because Rumba is heavily threaded and written largely in dfns, it has to use some tradfn workarounds to avoid a long-standing bug in the interpreter. This bug is now fixed in Dyalog version 19, so we can eliminate the workarounds.  </p>
        <p>Taking advantage of Conga's HTTP mode while not substantially rewriting Rumba required certain decisions about threading. The current threading model may not be the best. In a future post we will review the threading model for Rumba, see how it was adapted to use Conga's HTTP mode, compare it to what Dyalog's <a href="https://github.com/Dyalog/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> does, and see if there are any better alternatives.</p>
