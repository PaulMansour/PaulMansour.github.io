        <p>For an Abacus application, we need a way to organize our CSS, apply themes, provide some default application layout and styling, and also let the programmer override everything.</p>
        <p>An Abacus document (and any element) has a <code>Style</code> property which is a vector of CSS rules. For static documents, this property is generally set directly by the programmer. When a document represents an SPA built on Abacus components, we need to be able to assemble additional rules, and provide a way for the programmer to organize them. Two additional properties are provided to specify CSS rules: <code>LayoutStyle</code> and <code>ApplicationStyle</code>. </p>
        <p>The <code>LayoutStyle</code> property contains CSS rules for top level layout. This might be something like the header, main and footer elements of the app.   </p>
        <p>For an SPA, the <code>Style</code> property of the root <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element should not be set (it will be overridden if it is set). Abacus will automatically set this property, constructing it from the 'LayoutStyle<code> and </code>ApplicationStyle` properties, as well as the component library styles.  </p>
        <p>The order in which styles are applied is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>LayoutStyle (user provided, though Abacus should have a library of useful ones)  </li>
          <li>Abacus Styles (provided by Abacus, including built-in component ) </li>
          <li>ApplicationStyle (user provided)  </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In other words, the programmer can provide styles to be applied before and after the built in styles provided by Abacus. These groups of CSS rules are, in the end, arbitrary. I'm not even sure the programmer needs to be able specify rules before the Abacus rules, but certainly after. However I do think it is useful to split apart, for example, a rule that says the button radius should be 5px, from a rule that says the &lt;body&gt; element of the document should flex.</p>
        <p>It should be possible to create an attractive application by simply specifying a layout provided by Abacus.      Abacus uses APL functions to construct CSS. We call these CSS functions. A CSS function takes a <strong>theme</strong> as its right argument. A theme is simply a namespace of names and values, defining colors, font names and size, and other parameters. It performs the same function as CSS custom properties.</p>
        <p>Much or all of this will probably change.</p>

        <p>First, grab a coffee and spend 32 entertaining minutes with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jIwILYjXrU">Theo</a>.</p>
        <p>Ok, now that you have enjoyed his sartorial stylings, lets talk about WebSockets and avoiding JavaScript. </p>
        <p>We have been experimenting with WebSockets and the HTMLRenderer. The goal is to see if it is possible to build a highly interactive desktop app with almost no JavaScript, where every UI interaction is handled by APL. This appears to work, and be a viable approach. We have implemented a datagrid which is probably the most intensive user interaction case for a business app.</p>
        <p>With the Abacus DataGrid, every single keystroke event is sent to the browser over a websocket. On each press of the down-cursor key, for examle, the event is sent to APL, which must determine if the grid should scroll, extract and prepare the data to display, render the HTML, send it back over the websocket to the client, which must then replace the innerHMTL of the table element. You can press and hold the cursor key and the datagrid will scroll as smooth and fast as an Excel user would expect. No latency. Awesome. </p>
        <p>But we are on one machine. What would happen if we tried to run the datagrid in a web app? Over the internet. From a client in Rome to a server in Los Angeles? At the Carlisle Group 2024 Italy Moot, we tried just that. Amazingly there hardly appeared to be any difference. Scrolling appeared to be just as smooth and fast. I assume it had to be a little slower, we just couldn't really notice it. It was not a scientific test, we just just scrolled around and observed how the performance felt.</p>
        <p>Next, we tried 3 connections/users in Rome to the same server in LA. What would happen if all 3 users tried to scroll around? Here we assumed the performance would degrade significantly. Asking a single APL server to handle a flood of keystroke events from multiple clients, where each requires not trivial processing, would be asking too much. We were not wrong, the performance degraded profoundly.</p>
        <p>It remains to be seen what architectural options there are for heavily interactive single-user  web apps in this model that require a lot of server power for each user. Maybe a different Docker container for each user, each with its own APL instance is viable, for a relatively small number users. Not sure how this would work, or even if it could, for a multi-user app if the users have their own APL instance.   </p>
        <p>For multiuser apps that do not require that much server power per user, the Abacus model of the  client passing every event to APL via a WebSocket may turn out to be quite viable.</p>
        <p>We'll see.</p>

          </h1>
          <h2>June 30, 2024</h2>
        </header>
        <p>To figure out and demonstrate how to write an application in Abacus, we need a useful test application. At this point, we don't even know what we need to know, we don't know the tools we need, how the tools should be structured and fit together. We need a test app to help us find out.    The app must be simple enough to easily understand, but complex enough to explore all the major functionality of the framework. A CSV file viewer and editor will fit the bill. This will require a high-performance, editable datagrid, menus, progress bars, message boxes, confirmation boxes, dialog boxes for properties and settings and more. Furthermore, we want to be be able to run the application locally, as a desktop app, or remotely as a single page web app (SPA). Let's imaginatively name it the "Abacus CSV Editor". It might even be a useful app!</p>
        <p>What follows is a first pass at structuring a framework for building apps in Abacus.</p>
        <p>We will need a <a href="https://github.com/the-carlisle-group/Abacus/tree/master/APLSource/CSVEditor">namepace</a> to encapsulate the code for the app. This will be a relatively simple app, so a single namespace will hold all the code. A complex app will generally require splitting things up into more namespaces. This namespace (let's call it the <strong>application namespace</strong>) will contain a <strong>build function</strong> that builds an APL DOM for the app. Here is the build function for the CSV Editor:</p>
        <pre><code>Build←{
     d←A.NewDocument''
     b←A.GetBody d
     a←b A.AutoComplete.New''
     d.AutoCompleteElement←a
     h←b A.New'header'
     h1←h A.New'h1' 'filename'
     mb←b BuildMenu''
     m←b A.New'main'
     g←m A.DataGrid.New''
     f←b A.New'footer'
     h2←f A.New'h2' 'x rows by n columns'
     d.Theme←##.Themes.Dark 0
     d.Layout←##.Layouts.Doric d.Theme
     d.Style←CSS d.Theme
     d
 }  
</code></pre>
        <p>The build function creates and returns a document. It will generally have calls to the  main Abacus API (<code>A</code>), and of course it can call custom sub functions (like <code>BuildMenu</code> above) to keep things manageable. This is the heart of the app. It defines the UI, and all the callbacks to events on the UI. For a single user desktop app, the function will be run once. For a multi-user web app, this function will be run everytime a user logs in, returning the rendered document to their browser. All state is managed in the document in APL. For a multi-user app, the document is a <strong>session</strong>.</p>
        <p>The application workspace will also have a something like this <code>CreateApplication</code> function:  </p>
        <pre><code>CreateApplication←{
     a←A.NewApplication 0
     a.Name←'Abacus CSV Editor'
     a.BuildFunction←'#.Abacus.CSVEditor.Build'
     a
 }
</code></pre>
        <p>This formally creates and returns an Abacus application object. At a minimum it will specify the name of the application and the build function. Let's take a look at the internals of <code>NewApplication</code>: </p>
        <pre><code>NewApplication←{
     a←⎕NS''
     s←#.Rumba.Core.NewServer 0
     s.Trap←0
     s.UseCongaHTTP←1
     s.Context←⎕THIS
     s.OnRequest←'OnRequestRumba'
     s.OnWebSocketUpgrade←'OnWSUpgradeRumba'
     s.OnWebSocketReceive←'OnWSReceiveRumba'
     s.Application←a
     a.Name←'[Application]'
     a.Server←s
     a.Sessions←⍬
     a.BuildFunction←''
     a
 }
</code></pre>
        <p>The first thing it does is create a Rumba server. The server is not needed if the app is to be run as a desktop app, but it costs nothing to create, so we throw it in regardless. The server knows the application, and the application knows the server. The application requires a name and a build function. The application will track sessions (an array of documents) if it is run as a multi-user web app. </p>
        <p>So, we have created an Abacus application object and provided it our build function. With the application object in hand, we can start up a web app using the Abacus API function <code>StartWebApplication</code>: </p>
        <pre><code>StartWebApplication←{
     s←⍺.Server
     s #.Rumba.Core.Start 0
 }
</code></pre>
        <p>The Rumba server is now listening for new connections, will run the build function and deliver a document to the client, establish a websocket, and respond to user actions on the client.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, we can start up a desktop app with the API function <code>StartDesktopApplication</code>:</p>
        <pre><code>StartDesktopApplication←{
     d←(⍎⍺.BuildFunction)0
     d.Style←CollectCSS d
     d.Caption←⍺.Name
     NewForm d
 }
</code></pre>
        <p>This runs the build function to create the document, then, in <code>NewForm</code>, creates an HTMLRenderer object and returns it.   </p>
        <p>In a future post we will look at styles, themes and layouts, which we are still trying to figure out, and bring some order to the chaos.  </p>
