        <p>One of the amazing things about old APL books is that no matter how many years have passed, no matter how many new language features have been added, there are invariably many useful nuggets to be gleaned from them. A lot of very smart people used APL back in the day.</p>
        <p>Consider the case of <code>⍒⍋</code> and its twin <code>⍒⍒</code>. A while back on the <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/APL_Farm">APL Farm</a> there was a discussion of the interpretation and usefulness of these combinations, which culminated with:  </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>So the conclusion is that if we are only dealing in permutations <code>⍒⍋</code> is  worthless since it's simply a slower <code>⌽</code>, and if we are not dealing in  permutations even Adám doesn't know what <code>⍒⍋</code> does so it is probably equally worthless.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I read this at the time with an uneasy feeling that somewhere, sometime, I had a use for <code>⍋⍒</code>, but promptly forgot about the whole thing. And then just the other day I was refactoring a test for a function that computes the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/rank-avg-function-bd406a6f-eb38-4d73-aa8e-6d1c3c72e83a">average rank</a>. And lo and behold:</p>
        <pre><code>      averageRankUp←{0.5×(⍋⍋⍵)+⍒⍋⌽⍵}
</code></pre>
        <p>and its sibling:</p>
        <pre><code>      averageRankDown←{0.5×(⍋⍒⍵)+⍒⍒⌽⍵}
</code></pre>
        <p>I wonder if and how average rank could be computed as efficiently or succinctly without <code>⍒⍋</code>. I know it can be computed using two outer products, but that is very expensive in time, space, and tokens. I also wonder if there are any other documented uses of these pairings. Given the discussion in the APL Farm where it was observed that <code>⍒⍋p</code> is <code>⌽p</code> for permutation <code>p</code>, it is probably no accident that this application of <code>⍒⍋</code> involves <code>⌽</code>.</p>
        <p>I was pretty sure I did not come up with these expressions on my own, and a short search of my library revealed that I had most likely lifted it from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Depth-Springer-Statistics-Norman-Thomson/dp/0387942130/ref=sr_1_1?crid=MEY9ZS4JFYYO&amp;keywords=apl2+in+depth&amp;qid=1679418843&amp;sprefix=apl2+in+depth%2Caps%2C180&amp;sr=8-1&amp;ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.f5122f16-c3e8-4386-bf32-63e904010ad0">APL2 in Depth</a> , a 1995 text by legends <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPujK-GvHGQ&amp;list=PLYKQVqyrAEj91hZHbJiWOENHZP4JT8VFv&amp;index=1">Norman Thompson</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1VMeSzJLyE&amp;list=PLYKQVqyrAEj91hZHbJiWOENHZP4JT8VFv&amp;index=12">Ray Polivka</a>.

        <p>This question was recently posed on the <a href="https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/52405/the-apl-orchard/">APL Orchard</a> regarding how the following logic should or  could be expressed given that an <code>:OrIf</code> cannot be mixed with an <code>:AndIf</code>: </p>
        <pre><code>       :If 'Linux'≡(⊃# ⎕WG'APLVersion')~'-64'
       :AndIf ~0∊⍴⎕CMD'which git'
       :OrIf 'Windows'≡(⊃# ⎕WG'APLVersion')~'-64'
       :AndIf ~0∊⍴⎕CMD'where git'
</code></pre>
        <p>Leaving aside the <code>:AndIf</code>/<code>:OrIf</code> issue, this style violates the prime  <a href="/donts">Dyalog Don't</a> directive <em>Don't use control structures</em>, especially in such a situation or context.</p>
        <p>A response was immediately forthcoming, cutting the Gordian knot:</p>
        <pre><code>:If ~0∊⎕CMD' git',⍨⊃'which' 'where'⌽⍨'Windows'≡'-64'~⍨⊃# ⎕WG'APLVersion'
</code></pre>
        <p>This is a much more APL-style solution as it removes all the essential control structures, and is also better from a general programming perspective as it removes all of the duplicated code. These two improvements are directly related; removing the control structures requires the  removal of the duplicated code. This is precisely why control structures should be avoided.  But dangling this much code off the end of an <code>:If</code> statement, or preceeding a dfn guard, still leaves a lot to be desired, and violates another <em>Dyalog Don't</em>. </p>
        <p>Why not name a function? How much easier on  the reader's eyes and brain is it to see:</p>
        <pre><code>     :If IsInstalled 'git' 
</code></pre>
        <p>or </p>
        <pre><code>     ~IsInstalled 'git':0 
</code></pre>
        <p>There is no need for a comment, either outside the function or inside the function. The name of the function and its literal argument say it all. Furthermore, by extracting <code>'git'</code> as an argument, we have a function that might be useful in many other places, and would make a good candiate for an item in a utility package. Even if the function is hard-coded in the application, and is only used once, the simple act of encapsulating and naming the code is very useful.</p>
        <p>Once we have a well-named function, we might even say, <em>who cares how the code is written!</em>   The fact that the code is in a function, that the function has a good name and a singular purpose, that the arguments are well-designed-- all of these things are more important than the style or technique of the code inside the function itself. It would be better to have the function named and then coded with all sorts of control structures than to have the naked APL-style solution following the :If statement.</p>
        <p>The benefits of an application composed of small, well-named and designed functions cannot be overstated. </p>

          <h2>February 27, 2023</h2>
        </header>
        <p>In a <a href="/posts/text-to-date">previous post</a> I discussed the problem of converting time strings to time numbers. I have now extracted this functionality from our main application, rewritten it, and made it an open source project, imaginatively, but prematurely, named <a href="https://github.com/the-carlisle-group\Text2Date">Text2Date</a>.                       Text2Date uses a modified version of the Dyalog format pattern that is the left argument of <code>1200⌶</code>.</p>
        <p>One useful recent, simplifying, insight gained in the process of rewriting  is that differentiating between undelimited  and delimited fixed-width formats strings is useful. Delimited fixed-width time strings must line up - the elements must be in the exact positions specified in the format string.   Undelimited format strings do not require that the time strings line up. For example, the format string <code>MMDDYY</code> can easily  process the character matrix:</p>
        <pre><code>123124
10125
  72476
011523
</code></pre>
        <p>yielding four dates:</p>
        <pre><code>      'MMDDYY' Text2Date '123124' '10125' '  72476   ' '011523'
20241231 20250101 19760724 20230115
</code></pre>
        <p>When there are no delimiters, we don't need to worry about where an element starts or ends. The time string is just a text representation of a date time packed into an integer. A missing leading zero is no problem. Leading and trailing blanks are no problem. Data in this format shows up all the time in Excel and CSV files out in the wild. </p>
        <p>In the case of undelimited formats, there is also no need that the input are time strings, numeric is just as good, if not better. <code>Text2Date</code> is now misnamed, as this works:</p>
        <pre><code>      'MMDDYY' Text2Date 123124 10125 72476 011523
20241231 20250101 19760724 20230115
</code></pre>
        <p>Three special format strings are also accepted: <code>Excel</code> or <code>Excel1900</code>, and <code>Excel1904</code>, which also work on text or numeric input:</p>
        <pre><code>      'Excel' Text2Date 35000 37125 41256
19951028 20010822 20121213
      'Excel' Text2Date '35000' '37125' '41256'
19951028 20010822 20121213
</code></pre>
