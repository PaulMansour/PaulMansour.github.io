          Aaron Hsu is giving a
          <a href="https://confengine.com/conferences/functional-conf-2022/speaker/interview/aaron-w-hsu?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_campaign=FnConf-speaker-profiles">talk
          at Functional conference 2022</a>
        </p>
        <p>In the interview Aaron says:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>More is accomplished by understanding the whole, than optimizing
          the part.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>That is a first class aphorism.</p>
        <p>
          It reminded me of the saying
          <em>premature optimization is the root of all evil</em>
          , I think extracted from the full Donald Knuth quote:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much
          time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the
          wrong times; premature optimization is the root of all evil (or
          at least most of it) in programming</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Aaron's formulation says more with less; it has a positive outlook.</p>
        <p>Looking forward to seeing his presentation.</p>
