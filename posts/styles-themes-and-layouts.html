For static documents, this property is generally set directly by the programmer. When a document represents an SPA built on Abacus components, we need to be able to assemble additional rules, and provide a way for the programmer to organize them. Two additional properties are provided to specify CSS rules: <code>LayoutStyle</code> and <code>ApplicationStyle</code>. </p><p>The <code>LayoutStyle</code> property contains CSS rules for top level layout. This might be something like the header, main and footer elements of the app.   </p><p>For an SPA, the <code>Style</code> property of the root <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element should not be set (it will be overridden if it is set). Abacus will automatically set this property, constructing it from the 'LayoutStyle<code> and </code>ApplicationStyle` properties, as well as the component library styles.  </p><p>The order in which styles are applied is as follows:</p><ol><li>LayoutStyle (user provided, though Abacus should have a library of useful ones)  </li><li>Abacus Styles (provided by Abacus, including built-in component ) </li><li>ApplicationStyle (user provided)  </li></ol><p>In other words, the programmer can provide styles to be applied before and after the built in styles provided by Abacus. These groups of CSS rules are, in the end, arbitrary. I'm not even sure the programmer needs to be able specify rules before the Abacus rules, but certainly after. However I do think it is useful to split apart, for example, a rule that says the button radius should be 5px, from a rule that says the &lt;body&gt; element of the document should flex.</p><p>It should be possible to create an attractive application by simply specifying a layout provided by Abacus.</p><p>Abacus uses APL functions to construct CSS. We call these CSS functions. A CSS function takes a <strong>theme</strong> as its right argument. A theme is simply a namespace of names and values, defining colors, font names and size, and other parameters. It performs the same function as CSS custom properties.</p><p>Much or all of this will probably change.</p></article></main><footer><p>Copyright 2021-2025 Paul S. Mansour</p></footer></body></html>
