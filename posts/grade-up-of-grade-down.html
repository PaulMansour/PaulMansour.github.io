A lot of very smart people used APL back in the day.</p><p>Consider the case of <code>⍒⍋</code> and its twin <code>⍒⍒</code>. A while back on the <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/APL_Farm">APL Farm</a> there was a discussion of the interpretation and usefulness of these combinations, which culminated with:  </p><blockquote><p>So the conclusion is that if we are only dealing in permutations <code>⍒⍋</code> is  worthless since it's simply a slower <code>⌽</code>, and if we are not dealing in  permutations even Adám doesn't know what <code>⍒⍋</code> does so it is probably equally worthless.</p></blockquote><p>I read this at the time with an uneasy feeling that somewhere, sometime, I had a use for <code>⍒⍋</code>, but promptly forgot about the whole thing. And then just the other day I was refactoring a test for a function that computes the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/rank-avg-function-bd406a6f-eb38-4d73-aa8e-6d1c3c72e83a">average rank</a>. And lo and behold:</p><pre><code>      averageRankUp←{0.5×(⍋⍋⍵)+⍒⍋⌽⍵}
</code></pre><p>and its sibling:</p><pre><code>      averageRankDown←{0.5×(⍋⍒⍵)+⍒⍒⌽⍵}
</code></pre><p>I wonder if and how average rank could be computed as efficiently or succinctly without <code>⍒⍋</code>. I know it can be computed using two outer products, but that is very expensive in time, space, and tokens. I also wonder if there are any other documented uses of these pairings. Given the discussion in the APL Farm where it was observed that <code>⍒⍋p</code> is <code>⌽p</code> for permutation <code>p</code>, it is probably no accident that this application of <code>⍒⍋</code> involves <code>⌽</code>.</p><p>I was pretty sure I did not come up with these expressions on my own, and a short search of my library revealed that I had most likely lifted it from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Depth-Springer-Statistics-Norman-Thomson/dp/0387942130/ref=sr_1_1?crid=MEY9ZS4JFYYO&amp;keywords=apl2+in+depth&amp;qid=1679418843&amp;sprefix=apl2+in+depth%2Caps%2C180&amp;sr=8-1&amp;ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.f5122f16-c3e8-4386-bf32-63e904010ad0">APL2 in Depth</a> , a 1995 text by legends <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPujK-GvHGQ&amp;list=PLYKQVqyrAEj91hZHbJiWOENHZP4JT8VFv&amp;index=1">Norman Thompson</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1VMeSzJLyE&amp;list=PLYKQVqyrAEj91hZHbJiWOENHZP4JT8VFv&amp;index=12">Ray Polivka</a>.
