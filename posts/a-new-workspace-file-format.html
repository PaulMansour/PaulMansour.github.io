I have also documented that <a href="/posts/the-problem-with-namespace-scripts">they have problems</a> that prevent using them to their full potential.</p><p>When we are able to define both scripted and unscripted namespaces, and when we are able to define the root namespace, all in a script, many very useful possibilites follow effortlessly.</p><p>First the Dyalog interpreter should be able to simply open a script that defines the root. Thus if we have a simple text file <code>myworksapce.apln</code>:</p><pre><code>:Namespace #
   ⎕IO←0
   A←⍳10
   :Namespace MySpace 
   :Type unscripted
       f←{+/⍵}
   :EndNamespace 
:EndNamespace
</code></pre><p>Then in the session all we need to do is:</p><pre><code>      )load myworkspace.apln
</code></pre><p>In other words, we have a new, non-binary file format for the workspace. Furthermore, it zips up very well, so we could have, say, <code>.dwsx</code> files that are compressed text versions of dws files, analagous to Microsoft Excel <code>.xls</code> and <code>.xlsx</code> files. (In my sample, a 13 MB binary workspace is 750 KB as compressed text.)</p><p>All sorts of possibilites arise with a zipped <code>.dwsx</code> file format, as it can contain, like <code>.xlsx</code> files, multiple files and folders.  For example, it could contain a <a href="https://help.dyalog.com/18.0/#UserGuide/Installation%20and%20Configuration/Configuration%20Files.htm#Configuration_Files">configuration file</a>.    It could have multiple namespace scripts and only load and fix code on demand.</p><p>A <code>.dwsx</code> would probably not be appropriate for developement, as it would have the same drawbacks as a binary <code>.dws</code> file, but for sharing code, transport and application distribution it may be ideal. A non-zipped <code>.apln</code> file, however, may be quite useful for development: Open a clear workspace, start coding, <code>)saveastext</code> and have a text file representation of the workspace.</p></article></main><footer><p>Copyright 2021-2025 Paul S.
