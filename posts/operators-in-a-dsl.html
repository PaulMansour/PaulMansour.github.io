        <p>When designing a number-crunching domain specific language (DSL) in Dyalog APL we have the luxury of using operators. This immediately presents many design issues. Operators decrease the number of functions in the DSL, reducing overall size and complexity. At the same time, operators increase the complexity of composing an individual expression by introducing more moving parts.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Note <code>⎕IO←0</code> and <code>⎕ML←1</code> throughout. In addition, all functions and operators defined below are simplified and unoptimized versions of production code.  </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Consider providing a <code>maximum</code> function and a <code>reduce</code> operator in the DSL as direct covers of their APL counterparts:</p>
        <pre><code>      maximum←{⍺⌈⍵}
      reduce←{⍺⍺/⍵}
</code></pre>
        <p>No end-user wants to think or type:</p>
        <pre><code>      maximum reduce StockPrice
</code></pre>
        <p>when he could type:</p>
        <pre><code>      max StockPrice
</code></pre>
        <p>which one can do in say, SQL. So instead we provide the aggregate functions like <code>sum</code> and <code>max</code>  in addition to their scalar counterparts:</p>
        <pre><code>      sum←{+/⍵}
      max←{⌈/⍵}
</code></pre>
        <p>As noted, fewer operators make more functions. However, many if not most of the primitive arithmetic and boolean reductions are so commonly used that they have useful and well-known names  like sum, min, max, any, all, etc. In addition, there are many more common  aggregate functions like average and variance that are not primitive scalar reductions and these would need to be provided directly as functions anyway. So this is an easy decision; the trade-off of more functions and fewer operators in this case is well worth it. </p>
        <p>Now let's take the next step: running aggregates. Again, we have the option of providing a single operator or an additional set of functions. In APL we use the scan operator with a scalar function for this. However, in our DSL, once we have named aggregate functions like <code>sum</code> and <code>max</code>, it makes sense to use the aggregate function as the operand rather than the scalar function on which the aggregate is based, so we might define a <code>running</code> operator as:</p>
        <pre><code>      running←{
          h←⊃61 ⎕ATX'⍺⍺'
          f←{⍵↑⍨⍵⍳'←'}1↓h
          f≡'sum':+\⍵
          f≡'max':⌈\⍵
          ⍺⍺¨,\⍵
      }
</code></pre>
        <p>Here the choice is more open for debate, but I think it is still clearly in favor of the operator, especially considering that moving statistics could be handled by just giving a left argument to the running operator. Now a single operator is reducing the need for a lot of functions that will have awkward names and that will not get called very often. Kx Systems took the opposite approach with q, but I can only imagine there was no choice, as k does not support user-defined operators. The proliferation of functions and the difficulty naming them <a href="https://code.kx.com/q/ref/sum/">is immediately apparent.</a> </p>
        <p>The derived function <code>sum running</code> is an example of a <strong>uniform</strong> function - a function that returns a result that is the same shape as its argument. The result of a uniform function generally depends on the totality of the items in the array - both the existence and the ordering of the items. This feature distinguishes them from scalar functions. There are many uniform functions that are not derived functions. Prime examples in APL are grade up (<code>⍋</code>) and grade down <code>(⍒)</code>, rotate <code>(⌽)</code> and first occurrence (monadic <code>≠</code>). A DSL may have many more like <code>lag</code> and <code>lead</code>:</p>
        <pre><code>      lag←{
           ¯1↓0,⍵
       }
      lead←{
          1↓⍵,0
       } 
</code></pre>
        <p>Uniform functions lend themselves to being applied to an argument that is conceptually grouped and or ordered. Yet again we are faced with the choice of an operator or a plethora of additional functions- functions that are even more awkward to name, and that require a lot of arguments. In this case there is simply no contest.  Going the route of additional functions is <a href="https://docs.1010data.com/1010dataReferenceManual/Functions/GroupFunctions/Group.html">not pretty.</a>   Let's define an operator <code>by</code> with the following syntax:</p>
        <pre><code>      R←[X] F by Y I [B]     
</code></pre>
        <p>Here <code>F</code> is any uniform (or aggregate - more on this later) function. <code>Y</code> is a suitable right argument for <code>F</code>, and <code>X</code> is an optional left argument for <code>F</code>. <code>I</code> is a grade vector that orders <code>Y</code>, or a set of grade vectors that groups and optionally orders <code>Y</code>.  <code>B</code> is an optional boolean selection vector that flags items to include and exclude in the computation.</p>
        <p>The <code>by</code> operator sorts and groups <code>Y</code> according to <code>I</code>, (optionally selecting by <code>B</code>),  applies <code>F</code> to each group, and then ungroups and reorders the results to correspond to the original argument <code>Y</code>. This is similar to the under <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Under">operator</a>, but I don't think it can handle this particular case.  </p>
        <p>Sorting and grouping is provided by grade vectors rather than providing corresponding values on which to sort and group for the same reason sorting in APL is a two-step process with grade up and grade down. In addition we extract some complexity from the by operator by computing I beforehand using grouping and sorting functions.</p>
        <p>Let's define <code>by</code> as follows:</p>
        <pre><code>by←{
     ⍺←⊣
     a i b←3↑⍵,⊂1⍴⍨≢⊃⍵
     g←{⍺{⍵⌷⍨⊂⍺}¨⊂⍵}
     (pa pb)←(⊆i)∘g¨a b
     sa←pb/¨pa
     r←⍺ ⍺⍺¨sa
     af←1=≡r
     ua←2=≢61 ⎕ATX'⍺⍺'
     ff←af∨ua
     z←(~⊃¨pb)∧~af
     (⊃¨pb)←1
     e←({|2-/⍸⍵,1}¨⍣ff)pb
     v←∊e\¨r,¨⍨z/¨0
     v[⍋∊i]
 }
</code></pre>
        <p>Now we can do a running sum from lowest to highest:</p>
        <pre><code>      A←100 2 1 8 12
      sum running by A (⍋A)
123 3 1 11 23
</code></pre>
        <p>In other words, for each item, find the sum of it and all items less than it. Let's also define a grouping function that can optionally take a grade vector as its left argument:</p>
        <pre><code>group←{
     ⍺←⍳≢⍵
     i←{↓⍵}⌸⍵[⍺]
     ⍺∘{⍺[⍵]}¨i
 }
</code></pre>
        <p>And some more data to play around with:           </p>
        <pre><code>      RowId←1+⍳10
      Account←1 2 3 3 1 2 1 1 1 2
      Payment←8 3 5 4 2 7 1 9 6 10
      Day←31 1 9 5 14 27 22 17 3 11
      M←⍉↑RowId Account Payment Day
      M
 1 1  8 31
 2 2  3  1
 3 3  5  9
 4 3  4  5
 5 1  2 14
 6 2  7 27
 7 1  1 22
 8 1  9 17
 9 1  6  3
10 2 10 11
</code></pre>
        <p>To round out our little DSL, let's also cover grade up:</p>
        <pre><code>orderUp←{
     ⍋⍵
 }
</code></pre>
        <p>Now we can compute a running sum of payments by account:</p>
        <pre><code>      M,sum running by Payment (group Account)
 1 1  8 31  8
 2 2  3  1  3
 3 3  5  9  5
 4 3  4  5  9
 5 1  2 14 10
 6 2  7 27 10
 7 1  1 22 11
 8 1  9 17 20
 9 1  6  3 26
10 2 10 11 20
</code></pre>
        <p>It is often useful to compute and save the ordering and grouping. So to find the ordered running sum of payments by account:</p>
        <pre><code>      G←(orderUp Day) group Account
      M,sum running by Payment G
 1 1  8 31 26
 2 2  3  1  3
 3 3  5  9  9
 4 3  4  5  4
 5 1  2 14  8
 6 2  7 27 20
 7 1  1 22 18
 8 1  9 17 17
 9 1  6  3  6
10 2 10 11 13
</code></pre>
        <p>And to find the previous payment for each day by account:</p>
        <pre><code>      M,lag by Payment G
 1 1  8 31  1
 2 2  3  1  0
 3 3  5  9  4
 4 3  4  5  0
 5 1  2 14  6
 6 2  7 27 10
 7 1  1 22  9
 8 1  9 17  2
 9 1  6  3  0
10 2 10 11  3
</code></pre>
        <p>The <code>by</code> operator is useful not only with uniform functions, but with aggregate functions as well. The result of the aggregate function on each group  is replicated to line up with the original argument:</p>
        <pre><code>      M,sum by Payment (group Account)
 1 1  8 31 26
 2 2  3  1 20
 3 3  5  9  9
 4 3  4  5  9
 5 1  2 14 26
 6 2  7 27 20
 7 1  1 22 26
 8 1  9 17 26
 9 1  6  3 26
10 2 10 11 20
</code></pre>
        <p>And we can apply a boolean selection as well:</p>
        <pre><code>      M,sum by Payment (group Account) (Day&lt;15)
 1 1  8 31  8
 2 2  3  1 13
 3 3  5  9  9
 4 3  4  5  9
 5 1  2 14  8
 6 2  7 27 13
 7 1  1 22  8
 8 1  9 17  8
 9 1  6  3  8
10 2 10 11 13
</code></pre>
        <p>There is a balancing act with respect to operators and functions. This is similar to  the balancing act of fewer functions with more arguments, versus more functions and fewer arguments. Overuse of operators can make individual expressions and discovery difficult. Underuse can lead to a proliferation of badly named and rarely used functions that have too many arguments.</p>
