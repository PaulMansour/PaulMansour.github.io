Almost all of the demos and introductions to this functionality love to show off the associated CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::backdrop">backdrop pseudo-element</a>, which allows us to style the background of the dyalog when it is being shown in a modal state.                Usually we see some CSS like:</p><pre><code>dialog::backdrop {
  backdrop-filter: blur(2px);
}
</code></pre><p>Which blurs out the background. This looks really nice. However, it turns out that it is a <a href="https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/dashboard/issues/703">ridiculously expensive effect</a>. If you have any changes to the dialog while it is open, the repaint is very slow. In our app, we have modal dialogs that contain small tables for editing. A background blur makes them unusable. </p><p>Another thing to watch out for is using <code>transform</code> to center a dialog element. It's a cute technique: put the upper left corner in the center, and then move it back and to the left by 50 percent. In Abacus-style CSS:</p><pre><code>     s.position←'fixed'
     s.left←'50%'
     s.top←'50%'
     s.transform←'translate(-50%, -50%)'
</code></pre><p>All well and good, but there is a side-effect of using <code>transform</code> that affects positioning. Elements with fixed position on a dialog box that is centered this way will be <a href="https://dev.to/salilnaik/the-uncanny-relationship-between-position-fixed-and-transform-property-32f6">fixed relative to the dialog, not the viewport</a>, which is what you would normally expect. We have autocomplete elements that pop up on dialogs, and this makes positioning them much harder. For now I have taken to fixing the size of the dialog, so I can center it directly with using <code>transform</code>.</p><p>To sum up, on &lt;dialog&gt; elements:</p><blockquote><p>Don't use <code>backdrop-filter: blur</code></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Don't use <code>transform</code>. </p></blockquote><p>Time to start a CSS Don'ts page perhaps.</p></article></main><footer><p>Copyright 2021-2025 Paul S.
