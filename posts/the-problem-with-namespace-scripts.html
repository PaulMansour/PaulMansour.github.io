        <p>
          In my list of
          <a href="/donts">Dyalog APL Don'ts</a>
          I have
          <strong>
            <em>Don't use namespace scripts</em>
          </strong>
          . Why? Namespace scripts are strange beasts. Like classes, they
          are a combination of code and stuff that gets executed and who
          knows what else. It's even hard to talk about namespace scripts
          - you would thinks they would be scripts that define a namespace,
          but they define a namespace script, not a namespace. Maybe they
          are not really scripts at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I would like to use namespace scripts to have a
          <a href="/posts/building-namespace-scripts">text file that represents
          an arbitrary namepace</a>
          or even an entire workspace. Unfortunately, this does not quite
          work for a number of reasons.
        </p>
        <p>Consider the following script:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>:Namespace Parent
      ParentFoo←{
          Child1.Child1Foo ⍵
      }
    :Namespace Child1
          Child1Foo←{
              GrandChild.GrandChildFoo ⍵
          }
        :Namespace GrandChild
              GrandChildFoo←{
                  +/⍵
              }
        :EndNamespace
    :EndNamespace
    :Namespace Child2 
          Child2Foo←{
              GrandChild.GrandChildFoo ⍵
          }
    :EndNamespace
:EndNamespace
</code>
        </pre>
        <p>Here we have a namespace, with two child namespaces, one of
        which has a child itself. All well and good. When this is fixed,
        however, references are injected all over the place:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>      Parent.GrandChild
#.Parent.Child1.GrandChild
      Parent.Child1.Child2
#.Parent.Child2 
</code>
        </pre>
        <p>By inspection we can see that every namespace has a reference
        to it injected into every sibling and direct ancestor (grandparent,
        great grandparent, etc.)</p>
        <p>And indeed, the Dyalog documentation somewhat incompletely,
        and I think incorrectly, and definitely unclearly, states this
        as:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The names of Classes defined within a Namespace Script which
          are parents, children, or siblings are visible both to one another
          and to code and expressions defined in the same script, regardless
          of the namespace hierarchy within it. Names of Classes which
          are nieces or nephews and their descendants are however not visible.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Classes rather than plain namespace scripts were probably the
          motivating factor to this design (See
          <strong>
            <em>
              Don't use a naked
              <code>⎕NEW</code>
            </em>
          </strong>
          , another
          <a href="/donts">APL Don't</a>
          .) Regardless, the interpreter should not be injecting references
          to things when fixing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot imagine that anyone relies on this behavior, but a simple
          non-breaking fix would be to allow some additional values as
          the left argument of
          <code>⎕FIX</code>
          , which already allows 0, 1 or 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would propose that a value of 3 would fix the namespace as
          1 does now, with the exception that is does no reference injection.
          Even more useful, and perhaps in addition or instead, a value
          of 4 would fix everthing, do no reference injection, and then
          <strong>
            <em>disassociate the code from the script</em>
          </strong>
          . In other words, after fixing the namespace script, the workspace
          contains regular namespaces, not a namespace script.
        </p>
        <p>In addition, we should be able to specifiy the root, currently
        illegal, so an entire worksapce may be represented in a single
        file:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>:Namespace #
  ⎕IO←0 
  ⎕ML←1
    :Namespace Rumba
        ...
    :End
    :Namespace XL2APL
        ...
    :EndNamespace
:EndNamespace
</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          A few other issues arise as well. There are at least two conditions
          where a function that happily exists in a namespace is unhappy
          to be in a namespace script. First, if the function has unmatched
          quotes. Second, if the function has
          <code>:Implements Constructor</code>
          , but
          <strong>not</strong>
          <code>:Access Public</code>
          . The interpreter is happy to fix these functions all by themselves,
          but not within a namespace script. Thus the rules for fixing
          functions within a script are different and tighter than fixing
          normal functions in the workspace.
        </p>
        <p>
          With these enhancements and fixes to
          <code>⎕FIX</code>
          , namespace scripts can fulfill their proper purpose.
