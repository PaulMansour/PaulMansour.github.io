        <p>In the second part of this series, <a href="/posts/anatomy-of-a-query-ii">Anatomy of a Query, Part 2</a>, we covered how columns from multiple tables are accessed in a single query. Unlike SQL, which requires joins at the table level, in FlipDB we can join data on a column-by-column basis, keeping our ability to trace FlipDB queries step-by-step, one name and one value at a time. In addition, this means pure APL solutions translate directly into FlipDB. The examples focused on column join syntax that generally requires a database with pre-specified foreign keys. In much ad hoc, real-world analysis, we have no such luxury; there is simply data, in a bunch of tables.</p>
        <p>There is one join syntax that does allow for complete generality, with no pre-specified keys, the <em>general join</em> syntax:</p>
        <pre><code>   T[X;Y].Z
</code></pre>
        <p>Where, where given the context of some starting table (let's call it <code>S</code>), then <code>T</code> is the name of some other table in the same database, X is one or more column names in S, defining the key in S, and Y is one or more column names in T, defining the the key in T.  X and Y must conform in number and in type. The names may be different. Y may be elided if the names are the same. Z is a column name in T. This syntax materializes column Z from table T in the table S, by doing the lookup specified by the keys. The result will be simple or partitioned depending on whether the runtime relationship is many-to-one or not.</p>
        <p>This is useful, but there are times when we may want to explicitly do look ups, to preserve the indices for further computation. FlipDB provides a <code>getColumn</code> function which will directly fetch a column from another table:</p>
        <pre><code>getColumn 'Table2.ColumnA'
</code></pre>
        <p>from another database:</p>
        <pre><code>getColumn 'Database2.Table2.ColumnA' 
</code></pre>
        <p>or from the same very same table, reaching out of the current context and getting the entire column:</p>
        <pre><code>getColumn 'ColumnA'
</code></pre>
        <p>Thus, in any query, at any point (in the where clause, the select clause, the having clause, etc.) an expression can just grab a column from anywhere. A column accessed this way is generally non-conforming; it's not going to line up with our starting table. This does not hinder its usefulness.  A typical use is simply to check if values exist in some list. For example, say in the Suppliers and Parts database we added a <code>Sanction</code> table that contains a list of cities that are sanctioned. In order to find existing suppliers in unsanctioned cities, starting in the Supplier table <code>S</code>, it's just simple APL:</p>
        <pre><code>not CITY in getColumn 'Sanction.CITY'
</code></pre>
        <p>Because FlipDB queries are just sets of names and expressions, the expression can do virtually anything. We can get an entire table using the <code>getTable</code> function. So starting in the supplier table <code>S</code>, we can materialize the parts table:</p>
        <pre><code>      getTable 'P'

        <p>The <code>transpose</code> function converts the table into a FlipDB <em>property space</em> (analogous  to a k dictionary): </p>
        <pre><code>      P=transpose D.GetTable 'P'
      P

</code></pre>
        <p>We can use the  <code>indexOf</code> and <code>index</code> functions, both analagous to their APL counterparts, to conform columns from one table to another. Entire tables can be made to line up by using the <code>conform</code> function. The full power of APL techniques and solutions is directly available to us in the expressions.    </p>
        <p>Because FlipDB queries are sets of names and expressions, each set applied in a certain way and in certain  context, and expressions, by definition, can do anything the FlipDB language can do, it follows that  a query can do pretty much anything. For example a query can do operating system commands like creating a folder, read a file, or write to a log. These are things that would normally be done in scripts or stored procedures. A query becomes a highly structured script, executed in the  context of some table in some database.</p>
        <p>In our next and final part in this series, we will look at how FlipDB allows multiple queries to run as a set and how each query can refer to values in previously executed queries.</p>
