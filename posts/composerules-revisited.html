        <p>In the previous post we looked at <a href="/posts/constructing-css-in-apl">constructing CSS programatically</a>. The <code>ComposeRules</code> function looked like:</p>
        <pre><code>ComposeRules←{
     ⍝ ⍵ ←→ Vector of CSS Rules
     ⍺←0
     0=≢⍵:''
     nl←⎕UCS 13
     ⊃,/((⍺&gt;0)/nl),⍺{
         0=≢⍵.Selector:⍺ ComposeRules ⍵.Rules
         b←(4×⍺)⍴' '
         s←b,⍵.Selector,' {',nl
         s,←⍺ ComposeDeclarations ⍵
         s,←¯1↓(⍺+1)ComposeRules ⍵.Rules
         s←s,b,'}',2⍴nl
         s
     }¨⍵
 }
</code></pre>
        <p>As is often the case when reviewing a function after a little time has passed, we wonder why we wrote it the way we did. Often there is a good reason, but also often there is not a good reason.</p>
        <p>There are at least two things that are bothersome about this  function. First, there is a nested dfn. I don't like to do this without a good reason, and I had a nagging feeling there was in fact no good reason. I was probably just in a hurry to enhance the function to handle nested rules. Second, and directly related, the main function is called recursively by explicit name, rather than using  self-reference (<code>∇</code>). A refactoring is in order:</p>
        <pre><code>ComposeRules←{
     ⍝ ⍵ ←→ Vector of CSS Rules
     ⍺←0
     0=≢⍵:''
     nl←⎕UCS 13
     1=≡⍵:⊃,/((⍺&gt;0)/nl),⍺ ∇¨⍵
     0=≢⍵.Selector:⍺ ∇ ⍵.Rules
     b←(4×⍺)⍴' '
     s←b,⍵.Selector,' {',nl
     s,←⍺ ComposeDeclarations ⍵
     s,←¯1↓(⍺+1)∇ ⍵.Rules
     s←s,b,'}',2⍴nl
     s
 }
</code></pre>
        <p>Removing the nested dfn allows recursion via self-reference - the whole thing is much nicer.</p>
