      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>This is the personal APL blog of Paul Mansour.</p>
      <p>The site serves at least two purposes. First, it acts as a test
      case for APL code that generates HTML and converts Markdown to HTML.
      Second, and more importantly, it is a permanent, central repository
      for issues and interesting things that come up in my day-to-day work
      as a practical APL programmer -- stuff that is generally scattered
      and lost in old emails or various chat boards or forums.</p>
      <p>
        The title of this site is taken from
        <a href="https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~jzhu/csc326/readings/iverson.pdf">Ken
        Iverson's Turing Award lecture.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The subtitle of this blog is taken from a series of
        <a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/a/j-e-thompson/1950025/">math
        books written by J.E. Thompson</a>
        : Arithmetic for the Practical Man, Algebra for the Practical Man,
        Geometry for the Practical Man, etc. I believe that Richard Feynman
        tought himself math from these books. This is, I think, the only
        thing I have in common with Richard Feynman.
